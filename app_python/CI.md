# Continuous Integration Workflow for App Python

The configuration for this workflow is stored in the `.github/workflows/build-app-python.yaml` file within the project repository.

The workflows runs on `ubuntu-latest`.

## Workflow Overview
The workflow consists of 3 jobs:

1. **Build:** Compiles the code, installs dependencies, runs unit tests, and lints the code using pylint.
2. **Security:** Scans the project for vulnerabilities using Snyk.
3. **Docker:** Builds a Docker image of the application and publishes it to Docker Hub.

The jobs are executed sequentially, with the Docker job depending on the success of the Build and Security jobs.

## Best Practices Utilized

### 1. Version Control Integration
The workflow is triggered on each push event affecting files under `app_python/` directory and the `.github/workflows/build-app-python.yaml` file.

### 2. Parallelization
The jobs `Build` and `Security` run in parallel, optimizing the overall workflow time.

### 3. Dependency Management
The workflow uses `actions/checkout@v2` for fetching the repository code and `actions/setup-python@v2` to set up Python environment. It also ensures that dependencies are up to date by upgrading pip before installing packages from `requirements.txt`.

### 4. Caching
Caching is implemented to speed up the workflow. The `Snyk` binary is cached to avoid downloading it on every run, improving efficiency.

### 5. Error Handling
The workflow employs error handling mechanisms such as `continue-on-error: true` for the pylint step in the Build job and conditional steps based on previous job results.

### 6. Security Measures
Sensitive information such as Docker Hub credentials and Snyk token are stored securely as GitHub secrets and accessed in the workflow using `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}`.

### 7. Timeout
Timeout limits are set to ensure that the workflow does not exceed a specified duration, preventing prolonged waits and potential resource wastage.

### 8. Docker Image Tagging
The Docker image is tagged with `latest` and pushed to Docker Hub. This helps in version management and ensures consistency across deployments.

## Conclusion
By using these good methods and taking advantage of GitHub Actions, the CI workflow for the App Python project ensures that the code is good, safe, and works well throughout development. It also automates tasks, reduces manual work, and makes it easy to update and deploy the application quickly.
