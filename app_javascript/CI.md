# Continuous Integration Workflow for App JavaScript

The configuration for this workflow is stored in the `.github/workflows/build-app-javascript.yaml` file within the project repository.

The workflow runs on `ubuntu-latest`.

## Workflow Overview
The workflow consists of 3 jobs:

1. **Build:** Compiles the JavaScript code, installs dependencies, and runs any necessary build scripts.
2. **Security:** Scans the project for vulnerabilities using a security analysis tool.
3. **Docker:** Builds a Docker image of the application and publishes it to Docker Hub.

The jobs are executed sequentially, with the Docker job depending on the success of the Build, Lint, Test, and Security jobs.

## Best Practices Utilized

### 1. Version Control Integration
The workflow is triggered on each push event affecting files under the project directory and the `.github/workflows/build-app-javascript.yaml` file.

### 2. Parallelization
Where possible, jobs are run in parallel to optimize the overall workflow time.

### 3. Dependency Management
Dependencies are managed using a `package.json` file, and the workflow uses npm to install and manage dependencies.

### 4. Caching
Caching is implemented to speed up the workflow. The `Snyk` binary is cached to avoid downloading it on every run, improving efficiency.

### 5. Linting
The code is checked for style and syntax errors using ESLint to maintain code quality and consistency.

### 6. Testing
Unit tests are run to ensure the correctness of the JavaScript code.

### 7. Security Measures
Sensitive information and security vulnerabilities are addressed by scanning the project for vulnerabilities using a security analysis tool.

### 8. Timeout
Timeout limits are set to ensure that the workflow does not exceed a specified duration, preventing prolonged waits and potential resource wastage.

### 9. Docker Image Tagging
The Docker image is tagged with appropriate versioning information to ensure consistency across deployments.

## Conclusion
By using these good methods and taking advantage of GitHub Actions, the CI workflow for the App JavaScript project ensures that the code is good, safe, and works well throughout development. It also automates tasks, reduces manual work, and makes it easy to update and deploy the application quickly.
