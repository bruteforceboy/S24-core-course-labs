## Terraform for GitHub 

The terraform files are under `/terraform/github`

### Commands & Output(s)
- `export TF_VAR_github_token=xxx`
- `terraform init` 
- `terraform apply`
- `terraform import github_repository.repo S24-core-course-labs`
![alt text](images/image.png)
- `terraform apply`

### Best Practices

#### Docker Resources:
- `docker.tf`: Contains Docker provider settings and Docker resource configurations.
- `variables.tf` & `outputs.tf`: Define and output variables specific to the Docker environment.

#### AWS Resources:
- `aws.tf`: Defines the AWS provider and specifies the AWS resources being created or managed.
- `variables.tf`: Contains all the variable definitions relevant to the AWS configuration.
- `outputs.tf`: Lists the output variables that provide valuable information post-creation of AWS resources.

#### GitHub Resources:
- `github.tf`: Manages GitHub resources, such as repositories and permissions.
- `providers.tf`: Specifies version and provider information, including GitHub.
- `variables.tf`: Holds variables related to GitHub configurations.

I followed best practices in Terraform naming conventions, ensuring each file is intuitively named according to its purpose, such as defining providers, variables, and outputs. This structure not only facilitates readability but also enhances maintainability.

Crucial to security and good practice, secrets were never hardcoded but instead passed as environment variables, minimizing risks associated with sensitive data exposure.

Throughout the development process, I leveraged Terraform's commands to maintain code quality and ensure reliable deployments:

- **Formatting and Validation**: Utilized `terraform fmt` to standardize code formatting and `terraform validate` to check for any potential errors in the configurations.
- **State Management**: Commands like `terraform state list` and `terraform state show` were indispensable tools for inspecting current state and planning resource modifications or deletions.
- **Targeted Applications and Imports**: The `target` flag proved useful for applying changes to specific resources when needed, offering fine-grained control over the infrastructure updates. For integrating existing resources into Terraform management, `terraform import` was employed, allowing me to seamlessly bring external resources under Terraform's purview without recreating them.
